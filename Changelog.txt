MORE BOWS CJ VERSION: 1.2.0

	1. Netherite Bow has no fire-Resistant? Fixed 
	
	2. Added Gilded Netherite Bow for my Mod Gilded Netherite 
		WARNING: You don't repair the bow with Gilded Netherite Ingot you repair it with Netherite Ingot, because I don't know how I can say if the Mod Gilded Netherite is installed than you can repair it with the ingot.Â  
		I can say that you need the mod and then it works, but this is not fine.
