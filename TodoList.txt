1. 
Config Maybe???
2.
Add Support for my Gilded Netherite Mod Finish! But???
IF you install this Mod you need Gilded Netherite, but this is not good.
IF the player has the Mod Gilded Netherite installed, then the new content is there. 
That's a lot better. But how? I make it so that you NEED the Mod!
